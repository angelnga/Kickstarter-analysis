# Kickstarter - Analysis challenge in Excel
Performaning analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends


# Overview of Project
This project is an assignmnet from Data Analytics program - Excel Module. It consists of two technical analysis deliverables. 
- Deliverable 1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart<br>
- Deliverable 2: Outcomes Based on Goals Chart<br>
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there is a specific factor that make a campaigns project successful. Understanding the campaign from start to finish so that the upcoming campaign can be set up to mirror other successful ones in the same categories. 


# Analysis and Challenges
- Use filters and Excel formula to create new datasets<br>
- Create visualizations using Excel charts and pivot tables<br>
- Interpret the summary data provided from the visualizations<br>
The most challenge part is to unstand the questions, knowing which data is needed to summarize and how it would present.
Testing and Googling helps a lot when working with privot table and formulas. 


# Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

Result:<br>
1.) May has the highest successful rate with over 100 and December has the lowest rate with less than 40.<br>
2.) Canceled rate has no relationship between months, successful and fail rate as it's very stable. 


# Outcomes Based on Goals

Result:<br>
Based on this graph you can see the performance of the past outcomes in each goal range.<br>
This graph could causes misleading and thought this is a trend.
Therefore, sample size plays a huge role affecting the percentage.<br>
For example, goal range of 45000 to 49999 has only 1 projects in total sample size, and is in a failed result, which shifted the graph with a 100% fail rate.
But that doesn't mean this goal range will always fail, as the sample size is too small to make an conclusion.<br>
It can only use as showing the a performace.
In this case, stacked column chart would be a better option that shows sample size and the ratio of the outcomes.<br>
